    <h1>Introductory Questions: Caroline Kopsky</h1>
        <p>1. Hello, my name is Caroline Kopsky, and I am a senior majoring in American Culture Studies and minoring in Political Science and Design.</p>
        <p>2. As a Design minor, I have only taken classes in studio settings where critiques of the aesthetic looks of the made product take place. I wanted to try something different, and I feel that learning HTML or CSS is helpful in the career field.</p>
        <p>3. I do not have any prior experience in HTML or CSS.</p>
        <p>4. I hope to learn how to use HTML and CSS at an advanced level and potentially Java script.</p>
        <p>5. Designing for a screen requries order and logistical thinking in order for creativity to occur in an aesthetic way, while designing on paper is more easily creative.</p>
        <p>6. <a href="https://www.anthropologie.com/en-gb/?utm_content=Brand+-+Core+-+Phrase&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_source=google&utm_term=anthropologie&utm_kxconfid=vx65edeg7&gclid=Cj0KCQjwmICoBhDxARIsABXkXlLs7LHBr7H11YFA3Y1Fb74I9S3ZU67Qyhl2ya_2L4f6Go6zM1XYwqMaAuBrEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds"> Anthropologie:</a> I think this design is effective because it gives users all of the possible options of where they could go on the website up front without being too much to take in. It offers visuals of the products being offered without showing everything they offer. The top bar of navigation options also stays with the user as they slide down on the page.</p>
        <p>7. <a href="https://www.southwest.com/">Southwest:</a> This website's front page offers a super easy way for users to book their flights. It effectively shows where to select as your destination and provides links to other options to consider when booking a trip including low fares, hotels, and car rentals. There is no question of where a user should go for what they are looking for. Additionally, once the flight dates and locations are selected, the website gives users every possible option and allows for filtering of fares and length of flights; there is a vast amount of information that the user would consider helpful when booking a flight listed on the pages. </p> 
        <p>8. <a href="https://coolors.co/ffcab1-ecdcb0-648943-8cc084-968e85">Coolers:</a> This website works well because it shows what the tool looks like before users jump right into using it, and the concept of the website is unique which intrigues users. It works well because users who are interested in pairing different colors together are interested in the visual aspect of this research as opposed to words. This website cuts straight to the chase with allowing users to look at colors.</p>

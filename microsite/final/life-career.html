      <div id="life-career-headers">Childhood:</div>
      <div id="life-career-text">Ashton Dumar Norwill Simmonds was born on April 5, 1995, in the Scarborough district of Toronto, Ontario, and raised in Oshawa. He is the second eldest of four children to his mother Hollace and father Norwill Simmonds, a pastor and gospel singer who released his first album as a high school student in Jamaica. Caesar attended the Seventh-day Adventist Church and private school in Oshawa. He is of Bajan and Jamaican descent.</div>

      <div id="life-career-headers">Religious Roots:</div>
      <div id="life-career-text">Caesar grew up in church, singing before his father’s congregation in Oshawa. He was raised listening to soul and gospel delivered through musicality and religion, even though his parents were cautious of temptations that came with music. Caesar longed for the city, which was an hour’s drive from his home.</div>

      <div id="life-career-headers">Finding Music:</div>
      <div id="life-career-text">At the age of 17, Caesar was kicked out of the house after a fight with his father on the weekend of his high school graduation; he was briefly homeless during this time. He felt no choice but to pursue his calling as a musician. After leaving his home, he began doing gigs. He connected with producers and future collaborators Jordan Evans and Matthew Burnett and began writing and recording what would be his debut EP Praise Break in 2014; it was No. 19 on the “20 Best R&B Albums of 2014” by Rolling Stone and the top projects of 2014 by Noisey Canada.</div>

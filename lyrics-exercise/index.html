            <div class="stanza">
                <p>5:34 a.m., I was about to start my day </p>
                <p>But she layin' there across me, so I stayed anyway </p>
                <p>Arms tied, legs numb, wrapped around my knee </p>
                <p>Sweetest of the sunflowers, yeah, you're the sun to me </p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="stanza">
                <p>I don't recall what you were wearin' on the first night we met </p>
                <p>Besides the subtle cloud around you from my last cigarette </p>
                <p>And you come from a good place with a happy family </p>
                <p>The only bad you've ever done was to see the good in me </p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>But I've been livin', waitin' on the day </p>
                <p>the good Lord willin', send you out my way </p> 
                <p>I've seen hard timеs, bad luck, all that in-between </p>
                <p>Sweetest of the sunflowеrs, yeah, you're the sun to me </p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>And I remember being younger and my mother told me the truth </p>
                <p>Find someone who grows flowers in the darkest parts of you </p>
                <p>Take heed when things get hard and don't you ever turn around </p>
                <p> You'll find someone, someday, somewhere that grows you to the clouds </p>
            </div> 

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>And you walked me home that evenin' when I could barely walk </p>
                <p>And you spoke to me so sweetly on the days I couldn't talk </p>
                <p>And now I'm seein' clearly and I'm growin' up so free </p>
                <p>Sweetest of the sunflowers, yeah, you're the sun to me </p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>I've been livin', waitin' on the day </p>
                <p>That the good Lord willin', send you out my way </p>
                <p>I've seen hard times, bad luck, all that in-between </p>
                <p>Sweetest of the sunflowers, yeah, you're the sun to me </p>
                <p>Sweetest of the sunflowers, yeah, you're the sun to me </p>
